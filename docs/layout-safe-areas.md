# Layout Safe Areas

Safe areas should help creators place captions, lower-thirds, logos, and sponsor marks where viewers can actually read them.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to design a podcast layout and see which regions are safe for text, speaker faces, brand marks, and visual moments.

## Relationship To Layout Review

Safe area review should start from episode context already in the workspace:

- speaker framing from `docs/speaker-framing-safety.md`
- destination crops from `docs/destination-crop-previews.md`
- readability checks from `docs/accessibility-readability-checks.md`
- preset layouts from `docs/preset-style-picker.md`
- canvas layers from `docs/canvas-layer-controls.md`
- brand placement from `docs/show-brand-kit-setup.md`
- reusable templates from `docs/show-template-adaptation.md`
- export warnings in `docs/export-readiness-review.md`

## Safe Area Types

Show guidance for:

- speaker face area
- caption area
- lower-third area
- logo area
- sponsor area
- thumbnail title area
- mobile crop area
- review watermark area

Guides should appear when useful and stay out of the way during normal preview.

## Layout Approach

Safe area review is moment first on real episode content: guides should help creators see readable placement on the current speakers, captions, and destination crops—not static overlays that ignore the finished layout.

## Checks

Flag layout conflicts:

- caption overlaps lower-third
- sponsor mark enters speaker face area
- logo is outside destination crop
- title card text sits under review watermark
- b-roll covers important speaker gesture

The product should link conflicts to the affected moment and destination.

## Review States

The product should use safe-area status to drive layout review and export readiness:

- **clear** — no overlap conflict for the targeted surface and moment
- **flagged** — show the conflict on the affected moment and preview surface; link directly to the fixing control
- **adjusted** — apply the chosen placement change and refresh destination and mobile previews for that moment
- **applied broadly** — carry the same adjustment to similar moments after the creator confirms it
- **accepted** — keep the current overlap when the creator marks it intentional and clear only the related safe-area warning, with the publishing consequence shown
- **blocked for export** — when the destination would hide captions, logos, or sponsor marks, hold export until the conflict is fixed or accepted with the consequence shown
- **not relevant for destination** — hide safe-area checks that do not affect the chosen export package

Each state should describe what happens in preview, export readiness, and template reuse—not only the label on the guide.

## Creator Controls

Safe areas should be adjustable while staying tied to real episode content. The creator should be able to:

- show or hide individual safe-area guides while designing the layout
- move captions, lower-thirds, logos, or sponsor marks out of an affected area
- switch to an alternate placement zone or layout for a destination crop when an element cannot fit safely
- preview the conflict on mobile or thumbnail crops
- apply a fix across similar moments after confirmation
- adjust a safe-area region for the current episode or save the change to the show template
- re-check safe areas against a different export destination, speaker count, or brand kit
- keep a deliberate overlap when the creator confirms it stays readable

A safe-area change should re-check the affected moment and destination rather than applying a static guide everywhere.

## Customization Indicator

A safe-area region either follows the show's saved layout or has been tailored for the episode in front of the creator, and the creator should always be able to tell which one they are looking at without leaving their edit.

Each region carries one customization status:

- following the show default — the region matches the placement saved in the show's reusable layout; this is the resting state and shows no marker
- customized for this episode — the creator has tailored the region's size or position for this episode only

Surface the customized status as a small quiet dot on that region's guide handle, not as a banner, so it sits beside the region the creator is already working on and never interrupts the edit. A region following the show default carries no marker at all. Hovering the dot should name the show default it was tailored from and offer a one-click return to that default for this episode.

Whether a customization is also saved back to the show's layout is a separate, independent choice:

- a customized region is local to the episode until the creator chooses to save it to the show's layout
- once saved to the show's layout, the region reads as following the show default again, because the tailored placement has become the new default
- so the dot means only "tailored away from the current show default for this episode," and it clears the moment the two agree—either by returning to the default or by promoting the change into it

This indicator only reports where the episode and the show default differ; it never re-flags safe-area overlap conflicts, which keep their own state on the affected moment and surface.

## Template Behavior

Safe areas should be saved with templates where appropriate, but each episode should re-check them against its actual speaker count, brand kit, and export destination.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes layout safety visible and reusable across presets, canvas editing, thumbnails, and exports. Close work that adds static guides without checking real episode content, or clears unrelated caption or framing warnings when a safe-area overlap is marked accepted.
